In the spring of 2023, I was studying Computer Science in my local college in Brazil before starting my freshman year in Minerva. Minecraft Assembled was the concluding project for the Introduction to Computer Systems class, taught in Assembly RISC-V. Me and other 2 colleagues worked on this project for 3 weeks. 

The game runs on the RARS and consists of 3, increasingly difficult levels. The goal is to obtain keys, that can open treasure chests, all while trying to escape from the darts from Creepers and Endermans.
