In the spring of 2023, I was studying Computer Science in my local college in Brazil before starting my freshman year in Minerva. Minecraft Assembled was the concluding project for the Introduction to Computer Systems class, taught in Assembly RISC-V. Me and two other colleagues worked on this project for 3 weeks.
